# Disclaimer 
This is a jumpstart guide for people who want to go down a technical career in IT and want to have a solid base to start from. I created this guide because, before I started learning about IT (as someone without a degree who wanted to get into IT) I wished there was something like this for me. Somewhat of a handbook that shows me exactly where I could start from.

You don't need to madman, no-life this stuff. Put aside some time everyday to try and study or learn something new, and do this consistently, that's it. Build a solid system and keep improving it as you see fit. You're the only one who knows yourself better than anybody. Make sure to also ditch the idea of "I'm a visual learner" or "I learn better from books". "Learning styles" are [myths](https://www.educationnext.org/stubborn-myth-learning-styles-state-teacher-license-prep-materials-debunked-theory/). Don't be afraid to learn from a book or a video.

# General Fundamentals
Get a fundamental understanding of what the parts inside of a computer are, and what they do. This will help you understand that the computer isn't a magic black box. Make sure to also get a fundamental understanding of an operating system. I personally would recommend Windows starting out (learn about the main file-system, how to do basic tasks, etc.). My reasoning for choosing Windows: you're probably using it right now (familiarity), and most of the users you're going to be supporting in your first job (most likely a support job) will be Windows users. 

Recommended way of learning about computer fundamentals: study for any of the the most current, recognized, entry-level IT certifications, and build a cheap computer. If you don't have the money to build a cheap computer, just study for the cert. If you can be careful, you can even open up your own computer while studying for the certification (this will give you a better physical view and understanding of things when you learn about RAM, CPUs, GPUs, Motherboards, PSUs, Storage, etc.). At the time of this writing, the CompTIA A+ is #1 in regards to entry-level IT certifications. The Google IT Support Professional certification is also gaining traction and this is the certification I personally studied for. 

After understanding the fundamentals of hardware, look to get an IT help-desk / support position and build practical skills needed for the support position simultaneously. Aggregate a bunch of support position job postings near you (or if you 're willing to relocate, aggregate the job postings of your destination location). Build a big compilation of the skills required. Keep in mind, job postings are wish lists, you don't need to know everything. "I don't think I have enough experience with X", "I don't even know how to do Y", "They're saying I need to know Z before applying", who gives a fuck. Apply anyway. 

Now, with this huge list, you have a basic map of some of the things you need to learn. Skim your "map" and find the MOST COMMON skills required. Trim it down as much as humanly possible into one bite-sized list. After you do this, now you know some practical skills needed for the support job. "Knowledge of network utilities needed", *Googles "what are network utilities?" "Oh, so stuff like ping, ipconfig, etc.? Cool, let me spend a few hours learning how to use these."* Remember, you don't need to know how to do everything. Most of the skills you'll need, you'll learn on the job. You just want to have a competent, technical base. A key thing to keep in mind is to add the things you've learned onto your resume. 

I understand there's a split between putting things on your resume in the form of "list your skill level with what you know" (example: basic experience with Active Directory) vs just listing things on your resume and having the interviewer determine your proficiency. IMHO, I think the latter is the best way to go about it. If you need help formatting your resume properly (or to have a more appealing resume), go to the [Resumes]("https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/") subreddit and post your resume there with all the personal information (name, address, phone number, etc.) blocked out. You can use the [ITCareerQuestions]("https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/") subreddit as well. 

*Note: Here's an explanation of what a [subreddit](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/subreddit/) is for those who don't know.*

*"Wait a minute, I don't want to mess with my computer while learning about some of this stuff."* At this point (by the time you reach this step), I'm pretty sure you've heard of VMs (virtual machines). Either way, if you haven't, get on that. Look into building a homelab if you want as well. You want to be able to have practical, hands-on skills.

A key thing to keep in mind when job searching is to try and get a job as close to you as possible (if you're looking locally). The reason for this is to help with financial issues (such as gas, wear & tear on your car, etc.). When using job searching sites such as Indeed, start off from the lowest mile radius and increase it if you can't find any hits. Make sure to search with keywords such as

- Technical Support I
- Technical Support 
- Help Desk Technician Engineer I 
- Help Desk Support
- Desktop Technician I 
- Help Desk Analyst 

*Note: Learn to use Indeed's search filter when looking for jobs. It can really help fine-tune your searches. A method for removing certain jobs from your search is "Job Name -keyword". For example, let's say you're looking for a Technical Support job but don't want one where you have to deal with any type of traveling. You can try entering "Technical Support -travel" and it'll help remove some of those jobs. Don't want a support job where you have to deal with travel or sales? You can try entering "Technical Support -travel -sales", etc.*
            
# Networking Fundamentals
After you 've either gotten the support role, or are done learning a solid set of common support skills needed for a job, get a fundamental understanding of networking. This is an absolute must from what I've learned. Knowing the basics of how computers talk to each other or communicate via a network is essential. You don't need to become some kind of networking god. You want to understand the fundamentals like: *"what is a router?", "what is an IP address?", "what is a network?", "what is the OSI model?"*. At the time of this writing, there are a few networking certifications that will help you understand all of these questions. The two most commonly mentioned are the CompTIA Network+ and the CCNA. For a broad dive, study for the Network+. For a deeper dive into networking (and if you're interested in a more network-oriented career, study for the CCNA). 

# Security Fundamentals
Having the basic knowledge of how to keep a computer secure and preventing people with malicious intent from doing damage to your computer is fundamental. There's an estimated amount of 70 million people that are victims of cybercrime a year. Again, for someone who's starting out in IT you're looking for a base. The CompTIA Security+ will give you this base. You'll learn the theory about things like phishing, encryption, DoS attacks, etc.

# Afterthoughts
- You'll always hear people say things like "certs are worthless, blah blah blah", who gives a fuck. Certifications are a great way to show that you're capable of learning and are really useful to help you learn a bunch of things. Certifications are only worthless if all you ever plan on doing is chasing certs (people call these types of people "paper tigers") and hoping they'll get you a job (which leads to my next thought).

- Apply theory with practical learning. If you're studying for the A+ or Google's IT Support cert, build a computer (seriously recommended) or something. Even if it's an extremely cheap computer you're not planning on using. Being hands-on with things reinforces what you're learning / learned. If you're studying for the Security+, you can go practice on websites like [overthewire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) which can give you some hands-on practice with the information you've picked up.

- Spend no more than an absolute maximum of one year in your first support role (unless support is where you want to spend your career). The "general rule" is 6 months - 1 year.

- You'll end up figuring out what lane to specialize in and where you want to end up in your career,
don't force it. Maybe you want to become a SRE (my personal goal), DBA, Pentester, whatever it is,
you'll end up where you need to be. Just trust yourself.

- Learn how to program. Don't try and avoid it. The current landscape is requiring people to know how to program (the shift to automation). Also, knowing how to code is very useful. You won't realize how useful it is until you put the time aside to learn how to program.

- There's a lot of concepts in the information above that you can apply towards any position. For example, You want to become a Cybersecurity Analyst? You already have your fundamentals down. Aggregate a bunch of job postings, and follow the same steps.

- What I've come to realize is that this field is a lifelong learning process. Putting things bluntly, if you don't like to constantly learn, you probably won't enjoy this field. Again, you don't have to be learning things 24 / 7 like some madman, sacrificing whatever social life you have. Just be constantly and consistently learning. This will eventually become a habit.

- You DON'T NEED to take the test for the certs. Just study for them. If you want to take them, spend money, and add them to your resume, go ahead. Either of these ways only benefits you. If you studied for a certification, why not take it and add it to your resume? That's just my thought process.

- Be very aware of "Impostor Syndrome" and "Paralysis Analysis". These things are both gifts and curses.

- Avoid burnout. If you need a day(s) or week(s) off, take one. Health is wealth and it should be your #1 priority over everything. If you want to go have fun, go have fun. Sitting behind a computer 24  / 7 isn't everything in life.

- Learn Linux at some point. It's not scary.

- You DO NOT need to start in a support position. Support roles are just the "easiest" to get into
in order to build experience and get the fuck out (again, unless support is where you want to spend your career. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that).

- Practice daily, the way is in training.
